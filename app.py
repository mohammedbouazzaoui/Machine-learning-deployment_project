#### Step 4: Create your API

In your `app.py` file, create a Flask API that contains:

- A route at `/` that accept:
  - `GET` request and return `"alive"` if the server is alive.
- A route at `/predict` that accept:
  - `POST` request that receives the data of a house in JSON format.
  - `GET` request returning a string to explain what the `POST` expect (data and format).
